'Your job as a team is to design a complete end-to-end distributed system.
However, each role must contribute:

- The manager must assign tasks and NEVER complete them alone.
- The developer must produce detailed pseudocode and implementation strategy.
- The tester must validate correctness, find issues, and request changes.

The manager cannot finish the solution without the others.

Do NOT say FINAL until the developer AND tester have contributed at least once.

Begin.'
