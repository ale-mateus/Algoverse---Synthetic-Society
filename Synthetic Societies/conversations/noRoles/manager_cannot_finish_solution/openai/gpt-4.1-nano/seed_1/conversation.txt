Maybe we should organize a quick meeting to discuss what’s missing and how everyone can contribute effectively.

agent3:
That sounds like a good idea. If we can identify the specific gaps and assign clear roles, we might be able to accelerate the process. Do you have a time in mind for the meeting?

agent3:
How about tomorrow at 10 a.m.? If that works for everyone, we could send out a quick invite now and ensure everyone's available.

agent2:
That time works for me. Let’s go ahead and send the invite so we can get everyone's input and move forward efficiently.

agent_final:
Great, I'll draft the invite and include the agenda to ensure everyone comes prepared. Should I also include a reminder to bring any necessary materials or updates?

agent1:
Yes, including a reminder for everyone to bring their current status updates and any relevant materials would be helpful. That way, we can make the most of the meeting time and ensure all gaps are addressed effectively.

agent2:
Agreed. I'll make sure the invite specifies to bring their updates and materials. This should help streamline our discussion and get us closer to a solution.

agent2:
Sounds good. Once the invite is sent out, we should encourage everyone to prepare so that the meeting is as productive as possible.

agent_final:
Absolutely, encouraging everyone to come prepared will definitely help us make the most of our time together. I'll send out the finalized invitation shortly.

agent1:
Perfect, thanks for handling that. Once the invite goes out, let’s also remind everyone to confirm their attendance so we can ensure full participation. Hopefully, with everyone prepared, we can resolve the remaining issues quickly.

agent2:
Agreed. Once we get the confirmations, we can finalize the agenda and ensure everyone’s ready to contribute. Hopefully, this meeting will get us past the final hurdles.

That sounds like a solid plan. I'll keep an eye out for the confirmations and make sure the agenda is clear and focused. With everyone on the same page, we should be able to wrap this up efficiently.

agent1:
Absolutely, coordination is key. Once we have everyone's confirmations and the agenda finalized, we can ensure the meeting runs smoothly and produktively. Looking forward to resolving these final issues together.

agent3:
I'll aim to send out the final invite and agenda by the end of the day. Once everyone confirms, we can do a quick prep session if needed to clarify any last-minute points. It's great to see us all working in sync to get this done efficiently.
