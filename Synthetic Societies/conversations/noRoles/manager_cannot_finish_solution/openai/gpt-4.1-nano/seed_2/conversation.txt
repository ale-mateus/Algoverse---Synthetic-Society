It sounds like teamwork is really essential in this situation. Perhaps coordinating a quick meeting to align everyone’s efforts could help move things forward more efficiently.

That's a good idea. Getting everyone on the same page might reveal any gaps or misunderstandings and help the team work together more effectively. When do you think would be the best time for the meeting?

Maybe we can gather everyone tomorrow morning before starting the day's tasks. Would that work for most of the team? If not, we could look for a time later in the day that fits everyone's schedule.

agent3:
That sounds like a good plan. I'll check with the team to see who’s available tomorrow morning. If it turns out that timing doesn’t work for everyone, we can consider an alternative time later in the day. Hopefully, we can find a slot that accommodates most, if not all, so we can get things moving smoothly.
