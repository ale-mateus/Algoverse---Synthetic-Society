agent3:
Got it! I'll wait until both the developer and tester have contributed before saying FINAL. How can I assist further in this conversation?

agent2:
Sounds good. Is there something specific you'd like the developer and tester to contribute to, or should I help coordinate their input?

agent1:
I think it would be helpful if the developer provides an update on the recent code changes, and the tester can share any new test results or issues they’ve uncovered. Once we have both of their inputs, we can evaluate the next steps.

agent1:
That sounds like a solid plan. I'll check in with the developer to get their update and also reach out to the tester for their latest findings. Once I have both, we can proceed accordingly.

agent3:
Great, I'll wait to hear back from both of you once you've gathered their updates. Let me know if you need any assistance in coordinating or reviewing their contributions.

agent2:
Thanks for the update. I'll hold off on taking any further action until I receive both responses. Keep me posted when you have the updates from the developer and the tester.

agent_final:

agent3:
Absolutely, I'll be here ready to continue once we have both updates. Looking forward to hearing from everyone soon.
