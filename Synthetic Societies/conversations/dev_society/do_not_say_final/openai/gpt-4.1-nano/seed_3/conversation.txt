engineer:
Understood. I'll wait for both the developer and the tester to have contributed before indicating that "FINAL" is appropriate. Let me know if you'd like to review any initial contributions or if there's a specific area you'd like to focus on first.

architect:
Got it. I'll hold off on marking anything as "FINAL" until we've seen contributions from both the developer and the tester. In the meantime, do we want to review any preliminary designs or specifications to ensure we're aligned before formalizing the contributions?

engineer:
That sounds like a good idea. Reviewing the preliminary designs now can help us catch any potential issues early and clarify expectations. Do you have the latest specifications on hand, or should I share a draft version for everyone's input?

architect:
I can send over the latest draft I worked on yesterday. It includes some initial diagrams and functional breakdowns. Once everyone has had a chance to review, we can discuss any adjustments before moving forward. Would you like me to share that now?

analyst:
Yes, please go ahead and share the draft whenever you're ready. It will be helpful to review it ahead of the upcoming discussions.

analyst:
Great, I'll send over the draft shortly. Once everyone has had a chance to review, we can coordinate our next steps.

summarizer:
architect: Thanks, analyst. I’ll upload the draft to the shared folder now so everyone can access it easily. If anyone has immediate feedback or questions, feel free to share. Looking forward to hearing everyone's thoughts once they've reviewed the document.

analyst:
Sounds good. I'll review the draft as soon as it's available and prepare any questions or suggestions I might have. Let's aim to keep the momentum going.

architect:
Once you've gone through the draft, please feel free to share your feedback. It’s helpful to gather everyone’s insights early so we can refine the design efficiently. I'll also be reviewing it on my end and will compile any questions or points for discussion. Looking forward to aligning on the next steps.

architect:
Thanks, architect. I’ll review the draft as soon as I have access, and I’ll prepare any questions or suggestions to ensure we’re all on the same page before moving forward. Once the developer and tester have contributed their feedback, we’ll be in a good position to finalize everything. Let’s keep the momentum going.

architect:
Absolutely, once both the developer and tester review the draft and share their insights, we'll be able to move toward finalizing the design. It’s important we get their perspectives to ensure completeness. In the meantime, I’ll keep an eye out for their feedback and prepare to address any issues they might raise. Let’s stay coordinated so we can wrap this up efficiently.

analyst:
Agreed. I'll make sure to prioritize reviewing the draft once it's available and will coordinate with the developer and tester to gather their input as soon as they’ve had a chance to review. Let’s aim to move forward smoothly once all contributions are in.

summarizer:
engineer: I'll review the draft as soon as I receive it. Once I’ve had a chance to look it over, I’ll share my feedback and any questions. Hopefully, the tester can also provide their input shortly after that so we can move toward finalizing the design.

analyst:
Sounds like a good plan. Once everyone has shared their feedback, we can consolidate and ensure all concerns are addressed before moving forward. Let’s stay in close communication to keep this on track.

engineer:
Absolutely. Keeping everyone aligned and ensuring all feedback is incorporated will help us make a solid decision. I'll keep an eye out for the draft and coordinate with the others to gather their input once they've had a chance to review. Let me know if any issues arise before then.

analyst:
Will do. I'll stay tuned and ensure we get everyone's input as soon as they're ready. Hopefully, we can move forward smoothly once we've compiled all feedback.

summarizer:
architect: That sounds like a solid approach. Once the developer and tester have shared their feedback, we can review everything together and make any necessary adjustments before moving towards finalization. Let's keep a close eye on the input coming in to stay on track.

architect:
Absolutely, once we receive input from both the developer and the tester, we'll review all the feedback together to ensure everything is addressed properly. I’ll keep monitoring for their contributions and coordinate accordingly to keep this process moving smoothly. In the meantime, everyone, feel free to prepare any additional questions or suggestions to streamline our next review session.

engineer:
Sounds like a good collective plan. Once the developer and tester share their feedback, we can have a comprehensive review and finalize the design accordingly. I'll stay attentive for their inputs and continue preparing on my end. Let me know if there’s anything specific you'd like me to focus on during the review.

engineer:
Thanks, I think focusing on the sections that are most critical to system stability and performance would be ideal, but I trust your judgment. Let's keep monitoring for their feedback, and once we have both contributions, we can move ahead with the review. In the meantime, I'll prepare some questions regarding the integration points to ensure we're aligned on those aspects.
