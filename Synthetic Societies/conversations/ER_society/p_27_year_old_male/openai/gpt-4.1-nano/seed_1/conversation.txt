First, I would immediately establish IV access with two large-bore IVs and start rapid fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline to address hypovolemia. I’d attach a cardiac monitor to assess rhythm and obtain vital signs continuously. 

While doing that, I’d check his airway, breathing, and neurological status to ensure airway patency and protect against further deterioration. Given his condition, I’d administer supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather mask to improve SpO2 and prepare for possible advanced airway management if his mental status worsens.

Next, I would draw blood for labs—CBC, electrolytes, blood glucose, renal function, coagulation profile, and perhaps point-of-care testing for quick assessment. A quick bedside glucose check is essential to rule out hypoglycemia as a cause of his altered mental status. 

Given his symptoms suggest possible hypovolemic shock or another acute process, I would consider an ECG to evaluate for arrhythmias or ischemia. 

I would also alert the rapid response team and prepare for possible advanced interventions like intubation if he becomes more unresponsive or airway protection becomes necessary.

EMT: Copy, er_nurse. Situation is a 27-year-old male, altered mental status, pale, diaphoretic, barely responsive after collapsing at gym. Vitals: BP 82/50, HR 142, RR 28, SpO2 91%. Initiated IV access with two large-bore sticks, started rapid isotonic saline infusion. Cardiac monitor showing tachycardia, likely sinus. Administered high-flow oxygen via NRB. Bedside glucose is 60 mg/dL. No signs of trauma. Scene suggests possible hypovolemia or other shock etiology. Preparing to monitor and support airway as needed. Will continue to assess and update.

er_nurse:
Thank you for the update. I’ll give a small bolus of Dextrose 25% (D10) cautiously to address his hypoglycemia—around 25 grams IV, considering his altered mental status. I’ll also reassess his response to fluids and monitor his vital signs closely. 

Since his blood pressure is very low and HR high, I’ll keep a close eye on his urine output if a Foley is inserted later, and consider ordering labs to check for electrolyte imbalances, kidney function, and possible markers of cardiac stress. 

I’d like to get an ECG now to rule out arrhythmias or signs of ischemia, given his tachycardia. Monitoring his mental status, vitals, and response to initial treatments will guide whether he needs airway intervention or other advanced support.  
 
I’ll also prepare for possible vasopressor support if his BP doesn’t improve with fluids, but only after reassessment and confirming no contraindications.

EMT: Understood. Administering D10 IV now—giving 25 grams carefully over a few minutes. Monitoring his mental status for any improvement. Continuing to keep a close eye on his vitals. Noticing his blood pressure remains low and tachycardia persists. Will prepare for further volume resuscitation and consider vasopressors if no adequate response to fluids. Also, ECG results should be available shortly. Will inform you immediately once we have the ECG and further labs.

er_physician:
er_nurse: Thank you. His mental status shows minimal improvement after the D10, but his BP remains refractory to initial fluid boluses. The ECG has just come back, showing sinus tachycardia with no signs of ischemia or arrhythmia. We are ready with additional fluids and vasopressors if needed. I’ll continue to monitor him closely and prepare to insert a Foley catheter to assess urine output as a further indicator of perfusion. Will update you as more data becomes available.
