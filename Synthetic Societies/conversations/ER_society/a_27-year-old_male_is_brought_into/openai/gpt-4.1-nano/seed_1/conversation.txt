summarizer:
The patient presents with hypotension (BP 82/50), tachycardia (HR 142), tachypnea (RR 28), and hypoxia (SpO₂ 91%), along with pallor, diaphoresis, and altered mental status. Immediate priorities include establishing IV access, administering oxygen, and performing rapid assessment to identify the underlying cause. An urgent bedside point-of-care ultrasound should be performed to evaluate for pericardial effusion, cardiac activity, and possible source of shock. Blood glucose should be checked to rule out hypoglycemia. Simultaneously, consider a 12-lead ECG to assess for arrhythmias. Prepare for possible advanced airway management if respiratory status deteriorates. Initiate fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids while monitoring hemodynamics. Given the presentation, differential diagnoses include hypovolemic shock (e.g., hemorrhage), cardiogenic shock (e.g., myocarditis, cardiomyopathy), obstructive shock (e.g., cardiac tamponade, pulmonary embolism), or distributive shock (e.g., sepsis, anaphylaxis). Further diagnostics and management will be guided by initial assessments and ultrasound findings.

er_physician:
Let's begin immediately. Start by ensuring the airway is patent — assess for any obstruction. Administer supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather mask to maintain SpO₂ above 94%. Establish two large-bore IV lines and begin rapid infusion of isotonic fluids like normal saline to address hypotension. Simultaneously, prepare for a bedside ultrasound—look for cardiac activity, pericardial effusion, and signs of right heart strain. Also, check blood glucose level to rule out hypoglycemia as a cause of altered mental status. Obtain a 12-lead ECG to evaluate for arrhythmias or ischemia. Keep the patient closely monitored—be ready to escalate airway support if he deteriorates. Once stabilized, guide further diagnostics based on your ultrasound findings.

er_physician:
The patient remains hypotensive and tachycardic despite initial fluid resuscitation. His mental status is barely responsive, and SpO₂ is marginally improved but still concerning. I will immediately perform a focused bedside ultrasound to check for cardiac tamponade, evaluate cardiac contractility, and look for signs of pulmonary embolism such as right ventricular dilation. Meanwhile, I will also send blood for type and crossmatch, complete blood count, metabolic panel, blood gases, and a lactate level. The ECG should be reviewed for any arrhythmias or signs of ischemia. If ultrasound reveals pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology, I will proceed with urgent pericardiocentesis. If signs point toward pulmonary embolism, I’ll consider anticoagulation once stable, or prepare for further interventions. The priority now is rapid diagnosis and definitive management.

er_tech:
Noted. I'll proceed with a bedside ultrasound now—checking for cardiac activity, pericardial effusion, and right ventricular dilation to assess for PE. Simultaneously, I’ll confirm placement and flow with a quick IV check, monitor vitals, and review the ECG once available. Blood samples are already being drawn. I’ll update with ultrasound findings immediately.

consult_surgeon:
The ultrasound is completed. Cardiac windows show a globally hypokinetic heart with no significant pericardial effusion. Right ventricle appears moderately dilated with abnormal septal flattening, suggestive of right ventricular strain, raising suspicion for a massive pulmonary embolism. No evidence of tamponade. The ECG reveals sinus tachycardia with S1Q3T3 pattern, consistent with PE. The patient's hemodynamics remain unstable despite aggressive fluid resuscitation. Given these findings, a high suspicion for massive PE is confirmed.  
Prepare for definitive management — proceed with emergent transfer for thrombolytic therapy or surgical embolectomy if available. If thrombolysis is chosen, ensure blood products are readily accessible. Maintain supportive care and prepare the OR for potential surgical intervention if embolism occludes bilateral pulmonary arteries and the patient decompensates further.

er_physician:
Given the high suspicion for a massive PE with evidence of right ventricular strain and persistent instability, the priority now is rapid definitive treatment. I will prepare for administration of thrombolytic therapy—preferably alteplase—if no contraindications exist. Ensure crossmatched blood is available in case we need to perform emergent surgical embolectomy. While arranging this, continue close hemodynamic monitoring, provide supplemental oxygen, and consider vasopressors like norepinephrine to maintain perfusion if needed. We must keep the patient warm and monitor for signs of further deterioration, including arrhythmias or worsening hypoxia. I'll communicate with cardiothoracic surgery for immediate surgical backup should thrombolysis fail or contraindications arise. Time is critical; we need to act swiftly to improve perfusion and prevent cardiac arrest.

er_physician:
I will proceed with administering the thrombolytic therapy now, ensuring that we're prepared for emergent surgical intervention if the patient deteriorates further or if contraindications to thrombolysis emerge. Continuous hemodynamic monitoring and support remain critical; I’ll update frequently on his response. We'll also prepare vasopressors to maintain perfusion, and keep all team members ready for rapid action. The goal is to restore pulmonary circulation quickly and prevent cardiogenic collapse.

er_physician:
The thrombolytic therapy has been initiated. I will monitor his vital signs continuously, watching for signs of improvement or deterioration. Keep prep for aggressive support with vasopressors in case hypotension persists, and ensure that emergency surgical options remain on standby. We'll reassess frequently with bedside ultrasound and clinical parameters. If there’s any sign of worsening stability or contraindications to ongoing therapy, we’ll act swiftly to adjust the plan—whether that means stopping thrombolytics, escalating vasopressor support, or proceeding to surgical intervention. Our immediate focus is stabilizing him and ensuring prompt definitive treatment.

Radio: EMT to receiving facility, scene is secure, patient is a 27-year-old male with suspected massive pulmonary embolism. Found hypotensive at 82 over 50, tachycardic at 142, tachypneic at 28, SpO₂ 91%. He was pale, diaphoretic, and minimally responsive. Initiated IV fluids, high-flow oxygen, bedside ultrasound shows right ventricular dilation, no pericardial effusion, ECG indicates sinus tachycardia with S1Q3T3 pattern. Thrombolytic therapy has been started en route. Continuous monitoring and support are ongoing. Patient remains unstable but stabilized with initial management; surgical backup en route. Will update further.

er_nurse:
Given the ongoing management, I will continue close hemodynamic monitoring. Keep an eye on his blood pressure, which remains low despite fluids. We'll need vasopressors like norepinephrine ready to maintain perfusion as needed. Continue to watch for any signs of deterioration — worsening hypoxia, arrhythmias, decreased responsiveness. 

Now, I’ll ensure he is kept comfortably sedated if he becomes more agitated, and maintain his oxygenation—consider adding non-invasive ventilation if tolerated, but only if it helps with oxygenation without compromising airway security. 

I’ll also reassess his fluid status soon—although aggressive fluids might worsen right ventricular strain in PE, so we need a delicate balance. If his blood pressure drops further or shows signs of shock, I’ll prepare to escalate support.

Let's keep continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring, and communicate with the transport team for rapid transfer once stabilization is confirmed. I will check labs again, particularly his lactate to gauge tissue perfusion, and review repeat vitals frequently.

er_tech:
Understood. We’ll keep the vasopressors ready and monitor closely for any changes. Continue frequent reassessment of vitals, mental status, and labs. I’ll also prepare to escalate support if needed, and coordinate with the transport team for definitive care. Keep me updated on any sign of worsening perfusion or hypoxia.

consult_surgeon:
The patient’s condition remains critical but stabilized slightly after thrombolytic administration. Blood pressure is now hovering around 90/60 with vasopressor support, and SpO₂ has improved to around 94% on high-flow oxygen. Continuous ultrasound shows improvement in right ventricular size and function, but the risk of deterioration persists. We’re preparing for urgent transfer to the thoracic surgical team in case surgical embolectomy becomes necessary. Keep close monitoring; alert me immediately if there’s any sign of hypotension refractory to vasopressors, decreasing mental status, worsening hypoxia, or arrhythmias. We need to maintain readiness to act swiftly.

er_physician:
The patient's vital signs have stabilized somewhat, but he's still critically ill. I will continue vigorous hemodynamic support with vasopressors and maintain close monitoring. His oxygenation is improving, and ultrasound shows better right ventricular function, but we must remain alert for any signs of recrudescence or deterioration. I’ll coordinate with the surgical team to prepare for emergent embolectomy if needed, and ensure all necessary equipment and personnel are on standby. Continue frequent reassessment of neurological status, cardiac rhythm, and perfusion parameters. Let's keep him warm, sedated as needed, and ready for further definitive interventions.

summarizer:
The patient's condition demonstrates initial stabilization following thrombolytic therapy, evidenced by marginal improvement in blood pressure, SpO₂, and right ventricular function on ultrasound. Despite this, he remains critically ill with ongoing support required, including vasopressors to maintain perfusion and close hemodynamic monitoring. Continued vigilance for signs of deterioration, such as persistent hypotension, hypoxia, arrhythmias, or neurological decline, is essential. The surgical team is prepared for emergent pulmonary embolectomy should clinical decline occur, especially if refractory shock or worsening hypoxia develops. Laboratory and vital sign reassessments are ongoing to guide further interventions. Supportive care includes sedation, warming, and ensuring readiness for escalation of hemodynamic and respiratory support as needed. Collaboration with the surgical team remains crucial for definitive management.

summarizer:
The patient's clinical course reflects initial hemodynamic stabilization after thrombolytic therapy, with some improvement in right ventricular size and function noted on serial ultrasound, and a slight rise in blood pressure to 90/60 mmHg. Despite these gains, he remains critically ill requiring vasopressor support to sustain adequate perfusion. His oxygen saturation has improved to approximately 94% on high-flow oxygen. Vigilant monitoring for potential deterioration continues, focusing on vital signs, mental status, arrhythmias, and repeat imaging as needed. The surgical team is on standby for emergent pulmonary embolectomy should he become refractory to medical management or demonstrate signs of clinical decline. Supportive measures such as sedation, warming, and preparation for escalation of respiratory and hemodynamic interventions are ongoing. Coordination among multidisciplinary teams remains essential to ensure timely definitive treatment and patient safety.

consult_surgeon:
The patient's condition continues to improve gradually. His blood pressure remains stable around 90/60 with ongoing vasopressor support, and his oxygen saturation is up to 94% on high-flow oxygen. He is now more responsive, though still critically ill. We are maintaining close hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring, with readiness to escalate support if necessary. The surgical team is standing by for emergent pulmonary embolectomy if he shows signs of deterioration or if thrombolytic therapy fails to sustain stability. We will keep him sedated and warm, ensuring optimal conditions for recovery, while carefully reassessing frequently. Collaboration with all teams remains vital to ensure the best possible outcome.

er_physician:
The patient's condition has shown some steady improvement, and he's now more responsive with stable blood pressures and oxygen saturation at 94% on high-flow oxygen. We'll continue vigilant monitoring, keeping the surgical team alert and prepared for any sudden deterioration. Given his current stability, we should also reassess the need for ongoing thrombolysis versus surgical intervention, but overall, we're cautiously optimistic. Ensure sedation levels are appropriate, and keep him warm while maintaining his airway security. I will review his labs again and coordinate with ICU for continued supportive care and close observation.

consult_surgeon:
The patient continues to stabilize gradually—his blood pressure remains around 90/60 with vasopressors, and his oxygen saturation is holding steady at 94% on high-flow oxygen. He’s more responsive now, though still in a critical state. We’ll keep up the vigilant monitoring, ensuring all supportive measures are in place. The surgical team is on standby should he show any signs of deterioration or refractory shock. I’ll review all labs again to check for any indicators of ongoing hypoperfusion or other issues. Our focus remains on maintaining stability, preventing deterioration, and making timely decisions about whether to continue thrombolytic therapy or proceed with surgical embolectomy if needed.

summarizer:
The patient's condition has shown cautious improvement, with blood pressure stabilizing around 90/60 mmHg, oxygen saturation maintaining at approximately 94% on high-flow oxygen, and increased responsiveness. He remains critically ill but stabilized enough to continue close monitoring and supportive care. The surgical team remains on standby, prepared to proceed with emergent pulmonary embolectomy if his clinical status deteriorates or if he develops signs of refractory shock. Ongoing assessments include laboratory re-evaluations to detect any lingering hypoperfusion or other complications. The multidisciplinary approach continues to prioritize maintaining stability, preventing deterioration, and reassessing treatment options to optimize outcomes.
