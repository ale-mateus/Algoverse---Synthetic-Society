consult_surgeon:
This patient is showing signs of hypovolemic shock likely due to significant blood loss or fluid deficit. Immediate prioritization is airway management, hemodynamic stabilization, and rapid identification of the underlying cause.

Start by ensuring airway patency; consider advanced airway if there's compromised consciousness. Initiate high-flow oxygen to optimize oxygenation.

Next, establish large-bore IV access—preferably two 16-gauge needles—and begin volume resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid fluids to stabilize blood pressure.

Simultaneously, order focused assessment—urgent FAST ultrasound—is essential to evaluate for free intra-abdominal fluid suggesting bleeding. Obtain bedside imaging rapidly.

Given the presentation, I am highly concerned about internal bleeding, possibly from trauma or ruptured vascular structures. Prepare for possible emergent operative intervention if the patient remains unstable after initial resuscitation.

Also notify surgical teams immediately, and prepare the operating room for potential emergent laparotomy. Continuous reassessment of vital signs and mental status is critical.

summarizer:
The patient presents with signs consistent with hypovolemic shock, including hypotension (BP 82/50), tachycardia (HR 142), tachypnea (RR 28), hypoxia (SpO2 91%), pallor, diaphoresis, and diminished responsiveness. Immediate priorities include airway management, oxygen therapy, and hemodynamic stabilization. An advanced airway should be considered if consciousness deteriorates. High-flow oxygen is initiated to maximize oxygenation.

Large-bore IV access, preferably two 16-gauge lines, should be established promptly for aggressive volume resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid solutions. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and mental status is essential.

A focused assessment with ultrasound (FAST) is urgently required to identify intra-abdominal free fluid suggestive of bleeding. The suspicion remains high for internal hemorrhage, possibly from trauma or ruptured vascular structures, necessitating preparedness for emergent surgical intervention if stabilization is not achieved through resuscitation.

The surgical team has been notified, and preparations for an emergent laparotomy should be initiated. Ongoing reassessment and supportive care will guide further management.

er_nurse:
Alright, let's move quickly. Ensure the airway is patent—if his mental status worsens or airway reflexes become compromised, prepare for intubation. Start high-flow oxygen via non-rebreather mask at 15 L/min, and consider early intubation if he's barely responsive or if there's concern for airway compromise.

Establish two large-bore IV lines with 16-gauge catheters and begin infusion of isotonic fluids—crystalloids like normal saline or lactated Ringer’s. We'll need to be aggressive but cautious; over-resuscitation can worsen bleeding, so monitor vitals closely.

I’ll now perform a rapid bedside ultrasound (FAST) to check for free fluid—if I see significant intra-abdominal fluid, that confirms ongoing bleeding and will accelerate surgical intervention plans.

Let me get the equipment ready and call for blood bank—type and screen now while we prepare for possible transfusion. I'm also preparing to monitor mental status closely; any deterioration will further support the need for intubation and aggressive resuscitation.

Meanwhile, continue to watch vitals and note response to fluids. If blood pressure remains low or worsens, we may need to escalate to blood products sooner.

consult_surgeon:
All right, excellent. Keep a close eye on his mental status and vital signs. If he shows any signs of worsening hypoxia or airway compromise, don't hesitate to proceed with re-intubation despite current airway management efforts. Maintain aggressive fluid resuscitation, but remember that ongoing bleeding may necessitate early transfusion—prepare for that accordingly.

Perform the FAST exam immediately and communicate findings to the surgical team as soon as possible. If free fluid is detected, especially with persistent instability, expedite transfer to the OR for definitive control of hemorrhage.

Meanwhile, ensure that blood products are crossmatched and ready in case we need to transfuse massive blood. Continue frequent reassessment, and prepare for possible rapid sequence induction if airway deterioration occurs. The priority remains to stabilize him hemodynamically while diagnosing the source of bleeding.

EMT: Dispatcher, this is Unit 23. We have a 27-year-old male patient brought in from the gym after collapsing. He's pale, diaphoretic, minimally responsive—alert but with gurgling respirations. Vitals: BP 82/50, HR 142, RR 28, SpO2 91%. No visible trauma noted. Initiated high-flow oxygen, placed two large-bore IVs with isotonic fluids, and prepared for FAST exam. Patient's mental status is deteriorating slightly; airway patency remains questionable. Will reassess continuously and prepare for possible intubation. Requesting rapid transfer to ED and alert surgical team for potential emergent intervention.

consult_surgeon:
Copy that, unit 23. Proceed with caution—keep doing the ongoing assessment, and prioritize airway management. Given the signs of airway compromise and mental status decline, prepare for rapid sequence intubation immediately. Ensure anesthesia and airway teams are on standby.

Continue fluid resuscitation, but be careful not to overhydrate, as ongoing bleeding could worsen with aggressive volume expansion. As soon as the airway is secured, reassess hemodynamics and prepare for blood transfusion if blood pressure remains unstable.

Perform the FAST ultrasound right now and communicate findings immediately. If intra-abdominal free fluid is confirmed and the patient remains hemodynamically unstable, expedite transfer to the OR for emergent laparotomy.

Keep me updated on vitals and airway status. The surgical team is on alert and ready for intervention at a moment’s notice. Your rapid actions are crucial here.

er_physician:
Understood. We are initiating preparation for rapid sequence intubation now. I'll ensure that all necessary equipment is ready—ET tube, medications, and suction. The patient’s airway assessment is worsening; I will position him to optimize intubation and monitor his oxygenation continuously.

FAST exam underway; I will inform you as soon as we have findings. Our immediate priority is to secure the airway, administer controlled sedation and paralysis, and proceed swiftly with intubation to protect his airway given the mental status decline.

Once airway is secured, I'll reassess his hemodynamics and review the ultrasound results to determine next steps. If intra-abdominal bleeding is confirmed and he remains unstable, I will prepare for urgent surgical transfer.
