It sounds like there might be a bottleneck due to dependency on others. Have you considered breaking down the solution into smaller parts or assigning preliminary tasks so progress isn't halted? That way, the team can work in parallel and speed up the process.

er_tech:
I agree, breaking the task into smaller, manageable steps could definitely help. I can assist by initiating some of the preliminary assessments or prepping the necessary materials so the rest of the team can proceed with their parts without delay. Let's identify which tasks can be delegated right now.

The goal is to minimize any further delays.

consult_surgeon:
