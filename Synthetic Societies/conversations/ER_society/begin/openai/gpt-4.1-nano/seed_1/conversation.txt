EMS units, multiple trauma alert from scene at 123 Main Street. Patient is a 35-year-old male involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision. Vehicle struck a tree; occupant was unrestrained. 

On scene, found patient unresponsive, pulseless, apneic. Bystanders initiated CPR. Multiple visible injuries: facial trauma, suspected femur fracture, and massive chest deformity. 

Initial scene assessment indicates high-energy mechanism, potential for severe multisystem trauma. 

Starting c-spine precautions, initiating manual stabilization. Applying oxygen via NRB at 15 L/min. Starting IV access with 18G in right antecubital. Administering advanced airway management en route as needed. 

Continue efforts to assess rhythm and provide defibrillation if indicated. Please advise if additional interventions or destination considerations are required.

consult_surgeon:
 EMS, this is the surgeon. Given the patient's presentation—unresponsive, pulseless, apneic with obvious high-energy trauma and massive chest deformity—immediate advanced airway management is critical. This patient is in cardiac arrest, likely due to a reversible thoracic injury such as tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, or massive hemorrhage.

I recommend continuing high-quality CPR, initiating rapid transport with the trauma alert activated, and preparing for emergent thoracotomy upon arrival if needed. Ensure that at least two large-bore IVs are maintained, and consider inserting a right femoral line en route for rapid access.

Given the signs of severe thoracic trauma, a pre-hospital pericardiocentesis could be lifesaving if tamponade is suspected, but definitive management will occur in the trauma bay or OR. Transport expeditiously, and keep me updated on any return of spontaneous circulation or changes in the patient’s status.

consult_surgeon:
 EMS, this is the surgeon. Conscious recognition of the severity here is critical. While I agree with priority in transport, I want to emphasize that if during transport there's any ROSC or signs of stabilization, a rapid assessment for tension pneumothorax could be performed with needle decompression if indicated. 

Otherwise, prepare to initiate definitive thoracotomy upon arrival if the patient remains in refractory cardiac arrest. Also, ensure that trauma surgical staff is alerted and ready in the OR to expedite intervention. Have the crash cart prepped with thoracotomy supplies, and consider formulating a clear plan for pericardial decompression and emergent bleeding control.

Keep me updated en route, and let's aim for rapid delivery to definitive care.

er_nurse:
EMS, I hear you. We'll continue high-quality CPR, monitor for any signs of ROSC, and keep the airway secured. I'll be ready for needle decompression if we see tension pneumothorax signs—absent breath sounds, distended neck veins, hypotension during transport. 

I'll alert the trauma team to be prepared for immediate thoracotomy upon arrival. Will keep you updated if anything changes en route, especially if ROSC occurs. In the meantime, I’ll ensure rapid IV infusion, monitor vitals closely, and prepare for the next steps once at the hospital.

er_nurse:
Understood. Keep me posted on any changes in the patient's status, especially if you note any spontaneous return of circulation or signs of tension pneumothorax during transport. Prioritize airway and chest compressions, maintain IV access, and prepare the trauma team for immediate intervention upon arrival.

consult_surgeon:
EMS, this is the surgeon. I appreciate everyone's coordinated effort. Continue with high-quality CPR and rapid transport, and stay alert for any signs of improvement, particularly spontaneous circulation or signs of tension pneumothorax—such as sudden respiratory difficulty, hypotension, or neck vein distention.

Ensure the airway remains secure, and if in transit any clinical signs suggest tension pneumothorax, perform needle decompression immediately with a 14 or 16-gauge needle in the second intercostal space at the midclavicular line on the affected side.

Prepare for immediate thoracotomy upon arrival if the patient remains in cardiac arrest. Keep communication open, and update me as soon as there are any changes. Our priority is rapid definitive care in the OR.

consult_surgeon:
EMS, this is the surgeon. Continue your aggressive resuscitative efforts and ensure rapid transport to the trauma center. If any signs develop suggestive of tension pneumothorax—unilateral chest rise, severe respiratory distress, hypotension—perform needle decompression without delay. 

Keep vigilant for any signs of ROSC en route; if there is a sudden return of circulation, reassess airway and breathing immediately. Make sure trauma surgical team is prepped for immediate thoracotomy upon arrival, as ongoing hemorrhage or cardiac injury could be the cause of arrest.

Stay focused, communicate any changes promptly, and prioritize rapid, coordinated handoff. We will do everything necessary on our end to expedite definitive care.
