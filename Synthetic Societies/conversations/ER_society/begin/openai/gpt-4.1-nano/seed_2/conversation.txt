er_physician:
Thank you. Let's start by assessing the patient's immediate condition. Can you provide the initial presentation details or any vital signs?

emt:
Copy. Patient is a 45-year-old male, found unresponsive at scene. No witnesses available to confirm incident details. Scene is safe. On scene vitals: BP 86/60, HR 124, RR 32, SpO2 88% on room air. Patient is pulseless and unresponsive. Initiated CPR immediately, attached AED, delivered one shock. No pulse after shock, continue CPR. Ongoing ventilations with NRB at 15 LPM. IV access attempted but difficult; will try again. Scene nearby indicated potential fall from approximately 15 feet. Will continue stabilization and transport.

emt:
Copy that. Continue with CPR, ventilation, and attempting IV access. I’ll update if patient shows any signs of return of spontaneous circulation or if we need to adjust interventions during transport. Please keep me posted if there are any changes.

er_physician:
Understood. Maintaining high-quality CPR, IV access is being reassessed, and ventilations are ongoing. We'll monitor for any improvement or signs of ROSC. Once stabilized enough for transport, alert me immediately if there's any change, especially if the patient regains spontaneous circulation or shows other concerning signs. Please continue to monitor vital signs closely during transport and inform me if you can obtain any additional information or if the patient’s condition changes.

er_physician:
Copy that. We’re continuing CPR, monitoring the patient closely, and attempting IV access again. We’re also preparing for rapid transport and will keep you updated on any changes. The scene is relatively stable, and we’re prioritizing high-quality compressions and ventilations. Once there’s any sign of ROSC or deterioration, I’ll notify you immediately. Please stand by for further updates.

summarizer:
The EMT reports the patient, a 45-year-old male, was found unresponsive at a scene following an estimated fall from approximately 15 feet. On scene, vital signs include BP of 86/60 mmHg, HR of 124 bpm, RR of 32 breaths per minute, and SpO₂ of 88% on room air. The patient was pulseless and unresponsive. Immediate CPR was initiated, and an AED delivered one shock without resultant ROSC. CPR and ventilations with a non-rebreather mask at 15 LPM are ongoing. IV access attempts are being re-evaluated, and preparations for rapid transport are underway.

The ER physician confirms the continued application of high-quality CPR with ongoing ventilations and IV access attempts. The plan prioritizes close monitoring for signs of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The transport team is instructed to notify immediately if ROSC occurs or if there are signs of deterioration. The overall scene remains stable, with emphasis on maintaining effective compressions and airway management during transport.

No conflicts or discrepancies have been identified; the focus remains on stabilization, close monitoring, and rapid transport to definitive care.

consult_surgeon:
Understood. Given the patient's presentation—unresponsive post-fall with signs of shock and ongoing cardiac arrest—our priority is rapid transport with continued high-quality CPR. The key will be to minimize interruptions and prepare for emergent definitive surgical intervention upon arrival if needed. Do we have any imaging or findings from the scene that might suggest an intracranial injury or thoracoabdominal trauma?

consult_surgeon:
At this point, there's no pre-hospital imaging available. The key concern is the mechanism—a fall from approximately 15 feet—raising suspicion for intracranial injury, cervical spine instability, and potential thoracoabdominal trauma. The patient’s vital signs are unstable with persistent hypotension and tachycardia, and no ROSC has been achieved despite CPR. Given these factors, upon arrival, I want to prioritize rapid assessment for intracranial hemorrhage, cervical spine immobilization, and thoracoabdominal injuries. We should prepare for emergent surgical intervention, possibly for intracranial bleeding or intra-abdominal hemorrhage, depending on what we find.

I'll ensure we’re ready for immediate imaging as soon as the patient is stable enough—specifically, CT scans of the head, cervical spine, chest, and abdomen. We need to have trauma and surgical teams ready for a potential operative case. Meanwhile, maintaining CPR and optimizing hemodynamics en route will be critical.

er_tech:
ER Physician: Copy all. We'll maintain high-quality CPR during transport, ensure continuous ventilations, and stabilize IV access as soon as possible. Prepare for rapid assessment upon arrival—prioritize airway, breathing, and circulation. Keep me updated on any changes in the patient's rhythm, ROSC, or vital signs. Have the trauma team ready for immediate imaging and interventions. Let's keep up the efforts and coordinate closely during transit.

er_physician:
Understood. We’re maintaining continuous CPR, and I’ll keep you updated on any signs of ROSC or changes in the patient’s condition. The team is preparing for rapid assessment upon arrival, including securing the airway, ensuring circulation, and preparing for emergent imaging. The trauma and surgical teams are on standby for immediate interventions if indicated. We’re closely coordinating and doing everything possible to optimize the patient’s chances. Keep me posted if anything new develops during transport.

consult_surgeon:
Copy that. The team is doing everything we can to support and maintain circulation during transport. Our focus remains on minimizing interruptions, ensuring airway stability, and preparing for immediate surgical intervention if necessary. I will update you promptly if there's any change in rhythm, ROSC, or hemodynamics. Keep the trauma and surgical teams ready for rapid deployment once the patient arrives. Let’s get him to the OR as quickly as possible.

er_physician:
Copy that. We'll continue high-quality CPR during transport, closely monitor vital signs, and keep the team prepared for rapid assessment and intervention upon arrival. We'll also stay in communication and update you immediately if there's any change in the patient's condition, especially if ROSC occurs or if there are worsening signs. Everything is aimed at minimizing delays for definitive surgical management. Keep the trauma and surgical teams on standby; we'll move swiftly once en route.

er_physician:
Acknowledged. We’re maintaining continuous CPR, closely monitoring all parameters, and coordinating with the team to ensure immediate assessment and intervention upon arrival.

er_tech:
ER Physician: Acknowledged. Continuing with high-quality CPR, keeping all teams alert for rapid assessment and intervention upon arrival. Maintaining airway, circulation, and readiness for immediate imaging or surgery. Keep me updated if there are any changes or if ROSC occurs en route. We’re prioritizing stabilization and swift transfer to definitive care.

summarizer:
The team consensus is focused on maintaining continuous high-quality CPR during transport, with vigilant monitoring for signs of ROSC or deterioration. The ED and surgical teams are preparing for immediate assessment and intervention upon the patient’s arrival, including rapid imaging—CT scans of the head, cervical spine, chest, and abdomen—and readiness for emergent surgical management. The mechanism of injury—a fall from approximately 15 feet—raises concerns for intracranial hemorrhage, cervical spine injury, and thoracoabdominal trauma, prompting careful immobilization and prompt imaging once stable.

Throughout transport, efforts are concentrated on effective airway management, ongoing circulatory support, and minimizing interruptions of chest compressions. The multidisciplinary teams are coordinated to facilitate swift transition from prehospital resuscitation to in-hospital definitive care. Continuous communication is maintained to ensure immediate response to any changes in the patient's condition or the attainment of ROSC.

The plan emphasizes rapid, efficient transfer, with all teams on standby for immediate intervention, including surgical procedures if indicated. The stabilizing priorities remain effective airway, circulation, and preparation for advanced diagnostics. No conflicts have arisen; the focus remains on rapid stabilization and definitive treatment.
