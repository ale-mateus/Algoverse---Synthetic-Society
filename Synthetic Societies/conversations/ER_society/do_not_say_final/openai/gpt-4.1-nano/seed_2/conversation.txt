Copy that. Ready to receive initial details on the patient.

summarizer:
Patient is a 45-year-old male presenting with chest pain ongoing for the past two hours. The pain is described as a pressure-like sensation, radiating to the left arm and jaw. The patient reports associated diaphoresis and nausea but no vomiting. No prior history of cardiac issues is noted, but patient is a smoker and has hypertension diagnosed two years ago, currently unmanaged. Vital signs are as follows: BP 150/95 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18/min, SpO2 98% on room air. Physical examination is unremarkable except for mild diaphoresis. No signs of respiratory distress or edema. ECG reveals ST-segment elevations in leads II, III, and aVF suggesting an inferior wall MI. Initial bedside troponin is pending. The patient reports no drug allergies. The patient is alert and communicative.

consult_surgeon:
Given the ECG findings of ST elevations in II, III, and aVF, this patient is experiencing an acute inferior wall MI. His vital signs are relatively stable, but time is critical. We need to activate the cath lab immediately for emergent coronary intervention. Keep him on continuous monitor, establish IV access, administer aspirin 325 mg chewed, and consider nitrates for pain control if he remains hypertensive and without contraindications. Prepare for transport to the cath lab now—no delay.

er_nurse:
Understood. I’ll start by confirming IV access—already have a 20-gauge in place—and prepare to administer aspirin 325 mg chewable now. I will also start continuous cardiac monitoring and note the current vitals. Nitrates can be considered if pain persists and blood pressure remains manageable. I'll prepare the patient for immediate transport to the cath lab and ensure that all necessary documentation and orders are in place. Please let me know if there's anything specific I should prioritize or monitor closely during the transfer.

er_physician:
Acknowledged. Continue to monitor for any signs of hemodynamic instability or arrhythmias during transfer. Keep the patient comfortable, and ensure the IV access remains patent. Watch for signs of ongoing ischemia or worsening pain, which may necessitate additional medications such as nitrates—assuming his blood pressure stays within a safe range. Be prepared for potential complications en route. Let's also confirm that the cath lab team has been notified and is ready for patient arrival.

er_tech:
ER nurse: The cath lab has confirmed they’re on standby and ready. I’ve administered aspirin and will keep the patient on continuous monitoring. Pain is currently managed with the initial dose of nitrates, which has slightly lowered his BP to 138/90. No arrhythmias are observed yet. I’ll stay vigilant for any change in condition or signs of instability. Let me know if I should prepare anything further for transport.

er_physician:
Thank you for the update. Ensure the patient's vitals are closely monitored, especially blood pressure and heart rhythm. Have emergency medications like vasopressors ready in case of sudden hypotension or arrhythmias. Confirm that all documentation accompanies the patient, including transfer orders and any relevant history. Keep the team alerted to any changes, and communicate with the cath lab team continuously. The priority now is safe, swift transfer and preparation for urgent intervention.

er_tech:
ER nurse: Understood. Vitals remain stable, BP at 138/90, HR 88, rhythm regular. No new arrhythmias. Patient is prepared for transport, documentation is in order, and the cath lab has been notified again on my end. I'll stay with the patient and monitor closely during the transfer. Let me know if there's anything specific to prepare or do before leaving.

er_nurse:
Thanks for the update. Keep a close eye on his vitals during transport—especially blood pressure, HR, and rhythm. Ensure the IV line remains patent and secure. Also, double-check that all necessary documentation, including transfer forms and recent labs, are with him. Let me know immediately if he develops any arrhythmias, hypotension, or signs of worsening ischemia. Once in the cath lab, verify the team’s readiness so there's no delay. I'll stay on standby for further instructions.

er_physician:
Roger that. The patient remains stable during transfer, with vitals holding at BP 138/90, HR 88, and a normal rhythm. IV access is secure, and documentation is complete. No signs of arrhythmias or hemodynamic compromise so far. Will keep monitoring closely and notify immediately if any deterioration occurs. Once arrived, I’ll confirm with the cath lab team to ensure they’re ready for prompt intervention. Keep me posted if there’s anything urgent on your end.

er_nurse:
Copy that. We’re nearing arrival now; vitals are still stable. I’ve double-checked the documentation—everything is in order. The patient remains alert and comfortable, no new complaints. I’ll continue monitoring closely and keep you updated if there’s any change. Once the patient is in the cath lab, I’ll coordinate with the team to ensure a smooth transition.

emt:
Acknowledged. Continue to monitor vitals during transfer. Keep me updated if any changes occur en route.

summarizer:
As the patient arrives at the cath lab, all preparation appears complete. The patient remains hemodynamically stable with vitals at BP 138/90 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, and a regular rhythm. Continuous monitoring has been maintained without any new arrhythmias or signs of deterioration. Aspirin administration has been confirmed, and nitrates have provided partial pain relief. Documentation is comprehensive, and the cath team is prepared for immediate intervention. No further adverse events have occurred during transfer. The plan involves prompt definitive management via coronary angiography and possible revascularization. Close observation will continue during and after the procedure.

emt:
Copy that. The patient is stable upon arrival at the cath lab, with vitals holding steady. Ready to proceed with angiography and intervention. Will keep a close eye and notify if any changes occur.

emt:
Acknowledged. Proceeding with urgent angiography now; will monitor for any signs of instability during the procedure. Will update if any significant change occurs.

consult_surgeon:
Initiate the coronary angiography immediately. Given the ECG findings and clinical presentation, I expect an occlusion in the right coronary artery or its branches, which is typical for inferior MI. Prepare for possible percutaneous intervention—if an RCA occlusion is confirmed, we’ll perform PCI with stent placement as indicated. Continue to monitor hemodynamics carefully throughout the procedure, and have vasopressors ready if needed. Keep the team on standby for any complications such as arrhythmias or hemodynamic instability. Let's prioritize restoring coronary flow without delay.

emt:
Acknowledged. Proceeding with urgent angiography now. Will continuously monitor vital signs and notify immediately of any instability during the procedure.

summarizer:
The patient underwent coronary angiography promptly upon arrival at the cath lab. The procedure revealed an occlusion in the proximal right coronary artery, consistent with an inferior MI etiology. Interventional cardiology team performed successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement, achieving TIMI 3 flow restoration. Throughout the procedure, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, with no episodes of arrhythmia or hypotension. Post-intervention, the patient was transferred to the recovery area for close monitoring. Post-procedure management includes continued antiplatelet therapy, monitoring for potential complications such as re-occlusion or arrhythmias, and supportive care as needed. Continuous vital sign assessment and neurologic checks will be maintained to observe for any adverse events.

er_physician:
The patient is now stable in the recovery area, with vitals remaining within normal limits—BP 135/85, HR 78, rhythm regular. The PCI was successful, resolving the occlusion with TIMI 3 flow restored. We will continue close monitoring for any signs of re-infarction, arrhythmias, or hemodynamic instability. Make sure the patient is on appropriate post-procedure medications, including dual antiplatelet therapy, and assess neurological status periodically. Continue with cardiac and vital sign assessments every 15 minutes initially, then gradually extend intervals as stable. Let's also prepare for early mobilization and patient education regarding lifestyle modifications and secondary prevention.

er_nurse:
The patient remains stable post-procedure, with vitals holding steady and no new symptoms or arrhythmias noted. I will ensure the continued administration of dual antiplatelet therapy, monitor neurological status, and keep close watch during these initial vital assessments. Early mobilization will be considered once stable, and I’ll prepare to educate the patient on lifestyle changes and secondary prevention measures. Continue to monitor closely and report any changes immediately.
