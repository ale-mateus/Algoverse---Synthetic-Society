It sounds like we're close to finalizing everything, but I want to make sure the UI adjustments suggested by the tester are adequately addressed before we wrap up. Developer, have you reviewed the UI feedback and started implementing those changes? And tester, is the current build stable enough for another review once those adjustments are made?

consult_surgeon:
I'm waiting for confirmation from both the developer and tester that their respective concerns and updates have been addressed before moving toward finalization. Please let me know when that occurs.

er_nurse:
I've checked in with the team, and it sounds like the developer has started working on the UI fixes, while the tester is preparing for a follow-up review once those changes are made. As an ER nurse, my focus is on ensuring the patient flow and safety aren't compromised during these adjustments. Once the UI is stabilized, I just want to confirm there's no impact on usability and access, especially for emergency situations. Keep me updated on their progress.
