architect:
Let's analyze each option carefully:

**Option A: Less than 90°**  
- This suggests the beveled angle is acute, less than a right angle.  
- Typically, bevels aim to create a slight slope to improve the margin but are usually not specified as being less than 90°, which covers a broad range.

**Option B: Less than 45°**  
- A bevel less than 45° would be relatively shallow, creating a slight angulation.  
- Historically, bevel angles are often small, to facilitate marginal adaptation and removal of unsupported enamel.

**Option C: More than 10°**  
- This gives a specific minimum angle, indicating that the bevel should be more than 10°, but not specifying an upper limit.  
- Is there a standard angle for cavosurface bevels? Usually, the bevel is at a small angle, often in the range of 10–15°.

**Option D: At an obtuse angle**  
- An obtuse angle is greater than 90°.  
- Bevels are generally not at obtuse angles because that would mean a broad, shallow cut, which isn't typical for cavosurface bevels meant to prepare enamel margins.

**Additional thoughts:**  
- The purpose of the bevel is to facilitate better bonding and marginal adaptation.  
- Standard bevel angles are often in the range of **10–15°**.

Given these, **Options B and C** seem most aligned with typical guidelines. **Option B** says less than 45°, but actual bevel angles are often quite small (around 10°). **Option C** specifies "more than 10°," which aligns with the idea that the bevel should not be too shallow (<10°).  

**Any initial thoughts or preferences on these options?**

architect:
Your analysis is thorough and accurate. To connect with standard practice — in cavity preparation for amalgam, the cavosurface bevel is typically made at a small angle to help with marginal sealing and retention. 

- **Most guidelines suggest bevel angles in the range of about 10° to 15°.**  
- **Option C (More than 10°)** aligns well with this, indicating that the bevel should not be shallower than approximately 10°.

Options like **less than 45°** are too broad, and **less than 90°** is too large and nonspecific. **At an obtuse angle** clearly doesn't fit the typical bevel design.

**Thus, the most accurate answer is likely:**  
**Option C: More than 10°**

Would you like to confirm this conclusion or explore the rationale further?

architect:
You're exactly right. The ideal cavosurface bevel angle in amalgam preparations is generally around 10–15°, making **"more than 10°"** the most appropriate choice here. This small angle ensures a good marginal seal without unnecessary removal of tooth structure.

I agree — **Option C** is the best answer. 

Would you like me to help draft a brief explanation to reinforce this concept for review?

architect:
Absolutely! Here's a brief explanation to reinforce the concept:

---

**In amalgam cavity preparation, the cavosurface bevel is typically made at an angle of about 10–15°.**  
This small bevel creates a slightly inclined margin that enhances marginal adaptation, improves seal, and facilitates finishing. Making the bevel **more than 10°** ensures it is neither too shallow nor too steep, optimizing the seal while conserving tooth structure.

**Therefore, the correct answer is:**  
**Option C: More than 10°**
