Let's analyze each option carefully.

A: "Use of GnRH analogues cause permanent reduction in size."  
My understanding is that GnRH analogues are used to shrink fibroids temporarily by inducing a hypoestrogenic state. However, once the medication is discontinued, fibroids tend to regrow to their original size. So, this statement might be inaccurate because the reduction is not permanent.

B: "Pregnancy following myomectomy is about 80%."  
This seems high but plausible, considering that myomectomy aims to preserve or improve fertility. Fertility outcomes post-myomectomy can vary based on numerous factors, but around 80% success rate for pregnancy seems somewhat optimistic—what do others think?

C: "Recurrence rate following myomectomy is about 20%."  
From what I recall, fibroid recurrence rates after myomectomy tend to be higher, often around 15-30%. So, 20% is within that range but perhaps on the lower side.

D: "Growth factors (IGF-L, EGF) stimulate myoma to grow."  
Growth factors like IGF and EGF are known to promote cell proliferation and could contribute to fibroid growth. This seems consistent with current understanding of fibroid pathology.

What does everyone think about these? Any preliminary thoughts or disagreements?

Let's evaluate each statement carefully:

**A: "Use of GnRH analogues cause permanent reduction in size."**  
This is inaccurate. GnRH analogues induce a hypoestrogenic state leading to temporary shrinkage of fibroids, but once discontinued, fibroids typically regrow to their previous size. The reduction is not permanent.  
**Verdict:** Incorrect.

**B: "Pregnancy following myomectomy is about 80%."**  
While myomectomy can improve fertility outcomes, an 80% pregnancy rate post-procedure may be somewhat optimistic and is likely context-dependent. Fertility outcomes vary based on fibroid characteristics, location, and patient factors, but this figure aligns with some literature reports for favorable cases.  
**Verdict:** Possibly plausible but optimistic; more conservative estimates often lower this percentage.

**C: "Recurrence rate following myomectomy is about 20%."**  
Recurrence rates can range from 15% to 30% in literature, depending on follow-up duration and patient factors. So, 20% is within the expected range.  
**Verdict:** Reasonable estimate.

**D: "Growth factors (IGF-L, EGF) stimulate myoma to grow."**  
Yes, growth factors like IGF and EGF are implicated in promoting cell proliferation and fibroid growth. This aligns well with current understanding of fibroid pathophysiology.  
**Verdict:** Correct.

### Summary:
- **A:** Incorrect — effects are not permanent.  
- **B:** Possibly optimistic but within plausible range.  
- **C:** Reasonable estimate.  
- **D:** Correct.

Would you like to discuss further details or implications of these options?

er_physician:
Thank you for the detailed analysis. Based on the information provided:

- **A** is indeed incorrect because GnRH analogues cause temporary shrinking, not permanent reduction.
- **B** is somewhat optimistic but can be considered plausible depending on individual circumstances.
- **C** aligns well with known recurrence rates.
- **D** accurately reflects the role of growth factors like IGF and EGF in fibroid growth.
