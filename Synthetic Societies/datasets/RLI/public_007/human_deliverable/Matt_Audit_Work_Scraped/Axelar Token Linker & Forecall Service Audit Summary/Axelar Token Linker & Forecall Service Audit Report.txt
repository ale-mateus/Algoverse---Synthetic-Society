========================================================================
Finding #1: The forecall and forecallWithToken can be called repeatedly with the same payload  
Severity : High  
Description:  
The functions `forecall` and `forecallWithToken` lack mechanisms to prevent repeated calls with the same payload. This could allow unintended or malicious execution of the same message multiple times.

Recommendation:  
Implement replay protection to prevent repeated execution of the same payload.

========================================================================
Finding #2: The tokenAddress is missing zero-address check  
Severity : Medium  
Description:  
The `tokenAddress` parameter is not validated against being the zero address. This could result in logic errors or unexpected behavior.

Recommendation:  
Add a `require(tokenAddress != address(0))` check to prevent invalid configuration.

========================================================================
Finding #3: TokenLinker has insufficient data validation  
Severity : Medium  
Description:  
There is a general lack of thorough validation on input data in the TokenLinker contract, which could lead to edge-case exploits or unexpected behaviors.

Recommendation:  
Enhance data validation across TokenLinker functions to ensure correctness and robustness.

========================================================================
Finding #4: Usage of solc optimizer  
Severity : Warning  
Description:  
Solidity optimizer is enabled. While this is generally beneficial, it can sometimes produce unexpected results and should be carefully evaluated.

Recommendation:  
Ensure testing covers any optimization edge cases, or disable the optimizer during development and enable it only for final deployments.

========================================================================
Finding #5: Floating dependency on AxelarGateway  
Severity : Warning  
Description:  
The contract depends on a floating reference to AxelarGateway, which may be updated or changed, potentially introducing compatibility or security issues.

Recommendation:  
Pin the dependency to a specific version and audit that version thoroughly.

========================================================================
Finding #6: Multiple ways to receive ether can lead to loss of funds  
Severity : Warning  
Description:  
The contract allows ETH to be received through various mechanisms, which can cause ambiguity or funds being stuck if not handled correctly.

Recommendation:  
Restrict and clearly document allowed ways of receiving ether and handle unexpected inputs.

========================================================================
Finding #7: The forecall function is missing any checks by default  
Severity : Warning  
Description:  
The `forecall` function lacks default checks, making it potentially unsafe for general use without external safeguards.

Recommendation:  
Add internal validation or restrict usage contextually to avoid misuse.

========================================================================
Finding #8: Typo in the error name  
Severity : Informational  
Description:  
A typo exists in the naming of an error, which could reduce code clarity and documentation consistency.

Recommendation:  
Correct the error name to maintain clean and readable code.
