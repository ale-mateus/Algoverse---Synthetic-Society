========================================================================
Finding #1: Two-phase Owner transfer
Severity : Medium
Description:
The contract implements a one-step owner transfer process. This may lead to accidental or malicious takeover of the contract if the ownership is transferred to an incorrect address.

Recommendation:
Adopt a two-step ownership transfer pattern (propose → accept) to ensure that ownership is explicitly claimed by the new owner.

========================================================================
Finding #2: Lack of data validation in init functions
Severity : Medium
Description:
Initialization functions lack sufficient validation of input parameters, which may result in misconfigured contracts during deployment.

Recommendation:
Add strict input validation (e.g., non-zero address checks) to all initialization functions.

========================================================================
Finding #3: Owner Can Cause DoS
Severity : Medium
Description:
The contract owner can unintentionally or maliciously cause denial-of-service scenarios by invoking privileged functions incorrectly.

Recommendation:
Restrict or safeguard administrative functions with additional checks to prevent misuse or accidental execution.

Repository
URL: https://github.com/MintDAO (private repo, commit 5ad4033)
========================================================================
Finding #4: Data Validation in sendNFTs()
Severity : Medium
Description:
Insufficient data validation in the `sendNFTs()` function may allow invalid cross-chain NFT transfers or system instability.

Recommendation:
Include rigorous validation checks on all inputs, especially when NFTs are transferred across chains.

Repository
URL: https://github.com/MintDAO (private repo, commit 5ad4033)
========================================================================
Finding #5: Lack of logging
Severity : Low
Description:
Some state-changing functions do not emit events, which hinders auditability and off-chain tracking of important actions.

Recommendation:
Emit relevant events for all major state changes and user interactions.

URL: https://github.com/MintDAO (private repo, commit 5ad4033)
========================================================================
Finding #6: Constructor Without Initializer
Severity : Low
Description:
Contracts using OpenZeppelin's upgradeable pattern have constructors without proper initializers, which may result in incomplete contract setup.

Recommendation:
Use `initializer` modifier from OpenZeppelin Upgradeable libraries instead of constructors.

Repository
URL: https://github.com/MintDAO (private repo, commit 5ad4033)
========================================================================
Finding #7: Upgradeable Contract Without Storage Gap
Severity : Low
Description:
The contract lacks a reserved storage gap, which may cause storage layout collisions in future upgrades.

Recommendation:
Reserve a gap using `uint256[50] private __gap;` to allow safe future upgrades.

Repository
URL: https://github.com/MintDAO (private repo, commit 5ad4033)
========================================================================
Finding #8: Usage of solc optimizer
Severity : Warning
Description:
The optimizer settings were not specified clearly or may be suboptimal, affecting debugging or gas efficiency.

Recommendation:
Clearly document and test optimizer settings across environments to avoid unexpected behavior.

Repository
URL: https://github.com/MintDAO (private repo, commit 5ad4033)
========================================================================
Finding #9: Owner role can be renounced
Severity : Warning
Description:
The contract allows ownership to be renounced without ensuring alternative access control, which may make the contract unmanageable.

Recommendation:
Add safeguards to prevent full renouncement unless a governance or fallback mechanism is in place.

Repository
URL: https://github.com/MintDAO (private repo, commit 5ad4033)
========================================================================
Finding #10: Exposure of sensitive data
Severity : Warning
Description:
Some internal contract data is unnecessarily exposed through public variables or functions, potentially aiding attackers.

Recommendation:
Restrict visibility of sensitive data or provide controlled getter functions.

Repository
URL: https://github.com/MintDAO (private repo, commit 5ad4033)
========================================================================
Finding #11: Floating pragma
Severity : Warning
Description:
The use of a floating pragma (`^0.8.0`) can lead to compilation with unintended versions of the Solidity compiler.

Recommendation:
Pin the pragma version (e.g., `pragma solidity 0.8.17`) to ensure predictable and secure behavior.

Repository
URL: https://github.com/MintDAO (private repo, commit 5ad4033)
========================================================================
Finding #12: Inconsistency of safeMint And transferFrom
Severity : Warning
Description:
There is inconsistency in the handling of `safeMint()` and `transferFrom()` functions, which could lead to unexpected NFT behavior.

Recommendation:
Ensure consistent access control, validation, and logic between minting and transferring operations.

Repository
URL: https://github.com/MintDAO (private repo, commit 5ad4033)
========================================================================
Finding #13: Abstract Contract Named As Interface
Severity : Informational
Description:
An abstract contract is misleadingly named as an interface, which can confuse developers and auditors.

Recommendation:
Follow naming conventions—use `Abstract` or `Base` suffix for abstract contracts and reserve `Interface` for pure interfaces.
