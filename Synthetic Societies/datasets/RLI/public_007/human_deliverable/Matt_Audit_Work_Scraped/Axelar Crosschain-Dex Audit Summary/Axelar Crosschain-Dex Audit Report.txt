========================================================================
Finding #1: Unhandled return value
Severity : High
Description:
A function call's return value was not handled properly, which could result in unnoticed failures or incorrect behavior in contract execution.

Recommendation:
Ensure that return values from all function calls, especially external ones, are properly handled and verified.
