LayerZero Audits - Ackee Blockchain
Audit Period: April 27 – May 3, 2022
Audit: LzApp + Tokens Audit
Commit: 87941ce (Re-audit Commit: 865a1ab)
==============================

Finding: Burn address issue
Severity: High
Description: Potential issues with handling the burn address could lead to loss or misallocation of tokens.
Recommendation: Implement appropriate checks and safeguards when interacting with the burn address.

Finding: Condition bypass
Severity: Medium
Description: Certain conditions in the code can be bypassed under specific scenarios, leading to unexpected behavior.
Recommendation: Harden conditional logic to prevent bypasses.

Finding: Low test coverage
Severity: Warning
Description: Some contracts lack sufficient unit tests, which may miss edge cases and vulnerabilities.
Recommendation: Increase unit test coverage, especially for critical functions.

Finding: Code duplication
Severity: Warning
Description: Duplicate code found in multiple areas, which may hinder maintainability and clarity.
Recommendation: Refactor contracts to reduce duplication via better use of inheritance and libraries.

Finding: ERC721, ERC1155 reentrancy
Severity: Warning
Description: Lack of reentrancy protections in functions dealing with ERC721/ERC1155 tokens could be risky.
Recommendation: Apply `nonReentrant` modifiers and follow checks-effects-interactions pattern.

Finding: Unresolved TODO
Severity: Warning
Description: Code contains unresolved TODO comments that indicate incomplete features or checks.
Recommendation: Address or remove all TODOs prior to deployment.

Finding: Unintended feature – Renounce ownership
Severity: Warning
Description: Renounce ownership functionality may not be desirable and can lock out future admin control.
Recommendation: Consider removing or modifying this feature to align with the intended trust model.

Informational:
- Public functions can be external
- Missing require message
- Missing zero length handling
- Missing documentation
- Hardcoded types

==============================
Audit Period: June 15 – 26, 2022
Audit: Solidity-examples Repository Audit
Commit: c7525a5
==============================

Finding: Renounce ownership
Severity: Medium
Description: Renouncing ownership could make contract upgradeability and administration impossible.
Recommendation: Remove or restrict this functionality if not absolutely necessary.

Finding: Dangerous transfer ownership
Severity: Medium
Description: Ownership transfer functions may allow assignment to untrusted accounts or contracts.
Recommendation: Introduce validation checks to mitigate risks of misconfigured ownership.

Finding: Lack of events in state-changing functions
Severity: Warning
Description: Some state-altering functions do not emit events, reducing transparency and traceability.
Recommendation: Add events to all critical state changes for auditability.

Warnings:
- Usage of solc optimizer
- Floating pragma

==============================
Audit Period: August 3 – 8, 2022
Audit: NativeProxyOFT20 / NativeOFT Audit
Commit: b0bd359
==============================

Finding: Accepting messages from untrusted remotes
Severity: Medium
Description: The contract may process messages from unauthorized sources.
Recommendation: Enforce strict verification of trusted remote addresses.

Finding: Constructor data validation
Severity: Medium
Description: Lack of validation in constructor parameters may lead to misconfiguration.
Recommendation: Add `require()` checks to validate constructor input.

Low Severity:
- Ownable pattern
- Missing override for ERC165

Warnings:
- Usage of solc optimizer
- Recent solc version
- Empty _srcAddress can bypass trusted remote check
- Unused _lzSend() function

Informational:
- Coding practice
- Zero token transfer
- Public functions
- Unused SafeERC20
