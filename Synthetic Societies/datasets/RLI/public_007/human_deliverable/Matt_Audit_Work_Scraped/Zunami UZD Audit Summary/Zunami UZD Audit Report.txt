Finding #1: Anybody can cause DoS of the protocol if the limits are set  
Severity : High  
Description:  
Improper handling of deposit/withdrawal limits allows any user to trigger a Denial-of-Service by reaching the set limits, effectively preventing others from interacting with the protocol.

Recommendation:  
Implement logic to handle partial fulfillment or queuing of transactions once limits are reached.

Finding #2: Daily deposit/withdrawal limits can be violated  
Severity : High  
Description:  
The implementation of daily deposit and withdrawal limits is flawed, allowing users to exceed the intended caps.

Recommendation:  
Fix the accounting logic that tracks and enforces daily limits.

Finding #3: The previewWithdraw function does not include fee calculation  
Severity : High  
Description:  
The `previewWithdraw` function omits fee deductions, potentially misleading users regarding expected returns from withdrawals.

Recommendation:  
Incorporate fee deductions into the preview logic to provide accurate results.

Finding #4: Fees can be set to 100% anytime  
Severity : Medium  
Description:  
The protocol allows setting fees to 100%, which could be abused to confiscate all user funds.

Recommendation:  
Enforce upper limits on fee parameters to protect users.

Finding #5: Two-phase transfer of ownership  
Severity : Medium  
Description:  
Ownership transfer is implemented using a two-step process, but it is not enforced or documented adequately.

Recommendation:  
Ensure clear implementation and documentation of the ownership transfer pattern.

Finding #6: Renounce ownership  
Severity : Medium  
Description:  
The contract includes a `renounceOwnership` function, which could unintentionally leave the protocol without an admin.

Recommendation:  
Evaluate whether renouncing ownership is ever desirable; restrict or disable the function if not.

Finding #8: Variable shadowing of the owner variable  
Severity : Warning  
Description:  
Shadowing of the `owner` variable may lead to confusing or unintended logic.

Recommendation:  
Rename variables to avoid shadowing critical identifiers.

Finding #12: Unnecessary call for currentAssetPrice  
Severity : Informational  
Description:  
A redundant call to `currentAssetPrice` adds unnecessary computation.

Recommendation:  
Remove or refactor the call unless needed for logic or gas optimization.
