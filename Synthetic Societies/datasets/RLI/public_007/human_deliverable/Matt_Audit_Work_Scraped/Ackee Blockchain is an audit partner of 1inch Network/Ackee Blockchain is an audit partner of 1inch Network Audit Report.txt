Finding #1: SWC-103 Floating pragma
Severity : Low
Description:
The pragma version is not fixed, which can lead to compatibility issues in the future as newer compiler versions may change behaviour.

Recommendation:
Use a fixed pragma version (e.g., `pragma solidity 0.8.4;`) to ensure consistent compilation.

Finding #2: Code duplicity
Severity : Low
Description:
Some functions share duplicated logic, which increases maintenance complexity and potential for bugs.

Recommendation:
Refactor the duplicated logic into internal helper functions for better maintainability.

Finding #3: Potential token decimals mismatch
Severity : Medium
Description:
Assumes tokens have the same number of decimals, which might not always be the case and can lead to calculation inaccuracies.

Recommendation:
Ensure decimals are explicitly handled or compared between tokens.

Finding #4: Unhandled division by zero – Zero and negative inputAmount is not handled
Severity : Medium
Description:
The contract does not properly validate that `inputAmount` is greater than zero, which may result in a division by zero error.

Recommendation:
Add input validation to ensure `inputAmount > 0` before proceeding with calculations.

Finding #5: Unauthorized withdrawal
Severity : High
Description:
Improper access control allows unauthorized users to withdraw funds from the contract.

Recommendation:
Implement strict access control checks (e.g., onlyOwner or require statements) on all withdrawal functions.
