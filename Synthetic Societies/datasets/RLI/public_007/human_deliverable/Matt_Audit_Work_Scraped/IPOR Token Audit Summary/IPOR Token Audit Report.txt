W1: Usage of solc optimizer
Impact: Warning Likelihood: N/A
Target: **/* Type: Compiler
configuration
Description
The project uses solc optimizer. Enabling solc optimizer may lead to
unexpected bugs.
The Solidity compiler was audited in November 2018, and the audit concluded
that the optimizer may not be safe.
Vulnerability scenario
A few months after deployment, a vulnerability is discovered in the optimizer.
As a result, it is possible to attack the protocol.
Recommendation
Until the solc optimizer undergoes more stringent security analysis, opt-out
using it. This will ensure the protocol is resilient to any existing bugs in the
optimizer.
Fix 1.1
Currently we are using optimizer in already deployed IPOR Protocol smart
contracts. Liquidity Mining is a part of IPOR Protocol so will be part of public
repo ipor-protocol where we are using optimizer. We will monitor future issues
related with Optimizer.

I1: Redundant inheritance of Ownable
Impact: Info Likelihood: N/A
Target: IporToken.sol Type: Dead code
Description
The IporToken inherits from IporOwnable. However, it does not use any
functionality the Ownable pattern provides. As such, it only adds
unnecessary complexity to the code and lowers the readability, implying that
the IporToken is somehow ownable.
Recommendation
Remove the inheritance of IporOwnable in the IporToken contract.
Fix 1.1
Redundant inheritance was removed from a contract.
