Finding #W2: Delegation does not expire
Severity : Warning
Description:
The delegation mechanism currently does not support expiration, which can lead to unintended long-term delegation and centralization risks.
Recommendation:
Consider implementing expiration logic for delegations to limit delegation duration and reduce centralization risks.

Finding #W3: The initializer can be front-run
Severity : Warning
Description:
The contract initializer lacks protection against front-running, which may allow attackers to interfere during contract setup.
Recommendation:
Add front-running protections such as appropriate access controls or use of initialization patterns that mitigate race conditions.

Finding #W4: The initializer does not have validations for the correctness of _token
Severity : Warning
Description:
The initializer function does not validate the _token address parameter, which can cause incorrect or malicious token addresses to be set.
Recommendation:
Add validation checks to ensure the _token parameter is a valid and expected token contract address.

Finding #W5: Declaration shadowing
Severity : Warning
Description:
Some variables are shadowed by declarations within inner scopes, which can lead to confusion or bugs.
Recommendation:
Avoid variable shadowing by using unique variable names or refactoring scopes.

Finding #W6: Unused function parameters
Severity : Warning
Description:
Certain functions declare parameters that are never used within the function body, leading to possible confusion or wasted gas.
Recommendation:
Remove unused parameters or document their presence if intended for interface compatibility.

Finding #W7: Outdated Solidity version
Severity : Warning
Description:
The codebase uses an outdated Solidity compiler version (0.4.24 in Revision 1.0), missing newer compiler improvements and security fixes.
Recommendation:
Upgrade to a more recent Solidity compiler version (such as 0.8.x) to benefit from language improvements, security enhancements, and better tooling.

Finding #W8: Division rounding error
Severity : Warning
Description:
Some arithmetic operations may cause unintended rounding errors during division.
Recommendation:
Use safe math operations or explicitly handle rounding behavior where division occurs.

Finding #W9: Set delegate with zero voting power
Severity : Warning
Description:
Delegates can be set even when they have zero voting power, which can cause misleading delegation states.
Recommendation:
Add checks to prevent setting delegates that currently have zero voting power.

Finding #W10: Inconsistent attemptVoteForMultiple checks
Severity : Warning
Description:
The attemptVoteForMultiple function has inconsistent validation checks, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
Recommendation:
Standardize and strengthen validation logic in attemptVoteForMultiple to ensure correct voting behavior.
