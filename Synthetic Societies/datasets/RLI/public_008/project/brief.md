## Work description

Please make an arrangement of "Singing In The Rain" for a small house concert. The instruments we will have in the concert are:
- Piano
- B-flat trumpet
- Trombone
- Tenor saxophone
- Bassoon
- Double bass
- Vocals
(one of each)

I want the arrangement to be as close as possible to the version by Max Raabe and the Palast Orchester as played here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP1cllftq5o. You won't be able to perfectly recreate it, since we have far fewer instruments, but all the main parts of their arrangement should be present in the arrangement you create.

For the vocals, just put the notes. There is no need to include the lyrics.

## Provided material

None

## Deliverables

- The full score of the arrangement (PDF and MusicXML formats)
- A MIDI export of the score
- A recording / audio rendering of the arrangement (MP3)
