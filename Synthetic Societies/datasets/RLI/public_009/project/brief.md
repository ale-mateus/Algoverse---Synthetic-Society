## Work description

Build an intuitive, self-hosted interactive dashboard that lets visitors explore why some countries score higher than others in the World Happiness Report. 

### Requirements

- Overview: The dashboard should include an overview map showing each country's overall happiness score.
- Data: use the provided data as the sole source for country scores and component metrics.
- Map: display each country shaded on a gradient that reflects its overall happiness score; add hover and click interactions that surface the country name and exact value.
- Detailed chart: place a second visual (e.g., stacked bar or spider chart) beside or beneath the map. This chart should be linked to the map, so when the reader interacts with one country on the map, the same country in the second chart is highlighted.
- Design: intuitive, user-friendly, and align with the theme of happiness.

## Provided material

Happiness data for the dashboard in `inputs/DataForFigure2.1WHR2021C2.xls`.
